todays Fortune

let me start with her gestures that she repose when we met , the wrinkles in her forehead and the way the eyebrows lifted up it created an ocean of mysteries in my mind ,all i could do was to flink my head and escape that mysteries. but all of the sudden i never thought that she could be the one with Fortune as she used to be . but i had this gut feeling that she is ready for all this as i was not sure but more than me she did handle it the best way i could imagine , the shyness her eyes, the modesty i her actions they were all propelling me that nothing has went wrong , that day passed easily cause she was there beside me and i was not feeling any fear of being alone , now one day has past that she left and i cant prevent the rush inside me . i just cant stop thinking of other things then her , and all i encounter now is that she is not less than a blessing for me , like there is nothing that she is missing in her personality ...
